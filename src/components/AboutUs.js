              <p className='aboutus-desc'><b>Brahma Kumaris Godly Spiritual University</b> is established by the incorporeal 
              <b> God-Father Shiva (the Supreme Soul)</b> as a foundation to recreate the new heavenly world. 
              It is also an internationally recognised Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) helping people of all religions,
               nationalities, and cultural backgrounds to recognise and experience the inner being (soul) and bring positive
                and magical transformation in personal lives through the practice of <b>rajyoga meditation.</b><br/><br/>
<b><i><u>Our Early Story</u></i></b><br/>
<b>'Om Mandli'</b> - as it was named, was a group of a few tens of children, mothers, young and old men, 
in the very beginning years around late 1936 who surrendered their lives in the direction towards God after 
some or other divine experiences they received while attending a Satsang (spiritual retreat) at <b>Dada Lekhraj's house</b>.
 Right at that time, not many realised the fact that it was God who was working through the medium of Dada Lekhraj. 
 But as they received such divine experiences, they kept attending the Satsang and continued on the path.
  They tolerated harsh words and opposition of the whole community including their relatives,
   because they followed celibacy and decided to walk on the path of purity shown by God.
   <b> Despite the incredible social upheavals that were going on in pre-partition India,
     these people, a group of about 384 came together, initially in Hyderabad and a year later they moved to Karachi</b>.
      With time, a simple and clear body of knowledge about the nature of the Soul, God, the World Drama Cycle, 
      and the present time became revealed. In 1950 (two years after partition),
       the Om Mandli group moved to its present location at Mount Abu in Rajasthan, India.
        Until then, these nearly four hundred individuals lived as a self-sufficient large family,
         devoting their time to intense spiritual study, meditation, karma-yoga, and self-transformation.
          Their undeviating faith, purity, and sacrifice are even now seen as an epitome of spiritual life. 
          Now those souls who were a part of the first group of Om Mandli are referred to as Dadi or Dada.</p>
